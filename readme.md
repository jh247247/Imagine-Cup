* Project description
  This was the codebase used for the 2015 Microsoft Imagine cup.

  Data flow diagram goes something like this:
  ADC -> FFT -> SNR detection -> WiFi module

  Code used to be much more complicated, but moving the ESP8266 module
  to NodeMCU made things much less complicated. Shame, I was proud of
  some of that code.

  Anyway, enjoy my (pretty hacky) code. I'm sure there's a better way
  to do some stuff in here but I'm just happy it works.
